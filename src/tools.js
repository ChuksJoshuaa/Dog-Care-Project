Our New Puppy Checklist can tell you everything your puppy will need to get settled. Planning to have all the supplies on hand can allow some extra time for bonding when you bring him home. Given you’ll want to start potty training on day one, reading up on some tips and tricks can help set you both up for success.
               Lastly, and maybe most importantly, you may want to start thinking about names in advance as well. Choosing a name and using it consistently is vital to puppy training.`,

    desc: `Puppies are curious, so encourage yours to explore his new home. Show him around the places and spaces where he’ll be able to spend his time. Puppies start teething around 12 weeks of age.. They also learn about their environment by putting things in their mouths. If he tries to chew on shoes or furniture, redirect him by giving him a toy instead. If you discover he’s chewed something he shouldn’t have after the fact, don’t scold him. He won’t understand why you’re upset. If you do catch him in the act, give him a firm “No,” and redirect him with a toy or game. Create a feeding routine by feeding him at the same times each day and in the same location. Sticking to a schedule helps him learn what to expect and can also help you anticipate his need to go potty.
           Potty training can begin immediately when you bring your puppy home. Consistency is the name of the game. Start by showing him his potty spot, wherever that may be, and use the same phrase like “go potty” to connect what he should do with what you’re asking of him. Let him sniff around and get familiar with the area, and if he goes potty, praise him or offer a treat to help reinforce that behavior in the future. Taking him out right after mealtime and before and after naptime can help reduce the chance of accidents in the house. It’s a good idea to start practicing leaving him alone from day one. Before putting him in his crate, take him out to potty. Then you can put him in his crate and leave the house, returning after just a few minutes. He may bark and 
           whine, but as you practice and build up the amount of time he’s alone, he’ll learn that you’ll come back. It’s also never too early to start obedience training. Potty training is important as mentioned above, but you also want to begin teaching him some basic commands like “sit,” “down,” and “stay.” Help him get used to his leash by taking him for short walks around your yard or wherever you have space. Avoid socializing with other dogs in public places until he’s had his vaccinations. You will want to take your puppy to see your veterinarian within the first week for an overall checkup. He may need some vaccinations and a parasite check. This is a great opportunity for him to experience riding in a car and meeting and interacting with new people. Your
           veterinarian will mostly likely encourage you to play with your puppy’s ears and feet as well as establish a consistent dental health routine. All these activities will help you and your puppy in the long run, especially if medical conditions arise. You may also want to introduce your new puppy to family and friends. This can be a great socializing experience for him but try not to overwhelm him with too many visitors at once. Allowing your puppy to meet children of all ages will help him develop into a well-rounded dog who loves people of all ages and sizes. Once your veterinarian gives the green light, you can begin socializing him with other dogs as well. Socialization and training are essential in helping your puppy become a well-mannered dog.`,

    blogTitle: "Importance of Feeding Puppy Food",
    blogDesc: `Simply put, puppies need puppy food. Puppies grow fast and need a high-calorie, nutrient-dense food to support their growth and development.

    desc: `Although puppies need puppy food, it’s not that simple when there are so many to choose from. Puppy food comes in a variety of options, from dry kibble to canned wet food. Plus, there are..formulas for large and small breeds and other specific health needs. Many puppy foods are available in dry or wet varieties. Both are a healthy and tasty option. Just make sure they’re both complete and balanced. Some wet foods are “all meat,” which won’t satisfy your puppy’s nutritional requirements. If you’re trying to decide between dry and wet food, there are a few different factors to consider. Most puppy owners find dry food more convenient since it doesn’t spoil as easily. 
           You can feed either wet or dry food exclusively or a combination of the two. Regardless of which option you choose, ensure you aren’t exceeding the total recommended daily calories based on your puppy’s size. Our puppy feeding chart for dry food can help you determine how much food to feed your pup. It’s important to note, however, that this chart doesn’t account for wet food. “If you decide to incorporate both wet and dry food into your puppy’s feeding program, it is critical to understand that the caloric contribution of both should not exceed your puppy’s daily caloric or energy requirements,” says Purina Nutritionist Allison Millican, PhD. “The caloric content 
           is reported on the packaging, and you should use these values to understand how much wet product will replace the dry and vice versa,” she says. “For example, one thirteen-ounce can of wet food may contain four hundred and seventy-five kilocalories and replace approximately one cup of dry puppy formula. In this scenario, you could substitute a thirteen-ounce can of wet food for one cup of the daily dry food recommendation.” “Remember,” she adds, “as your puppy grows, his body condition may change rapidly, so it is important to adjust as necessary to maintain his ideal body weight. You can find more feeding and calorie information on the brand’s website or consult
           your veterinarian to assist you in developing a feeding plan specific to your puppy’s needs.” Dry or wet isn’t the only thing to consider when choosing a puppy food. You also need to factor in your puppy’s breed size. Large breed puppies have a higher risk of developing joint problems as adults. Feeding a large breed-specific puppy food can help support joint health and mobility into adulthood. Small breed puppies have smaller mouths, so they may prefer the smaller kibble found in small breed-specific puppy formulas. “Small breed puppies also have a higher metabolism and therefore require more energy and a more nutrient dense diet,” says Purina Nutritionist, Karina
           Carbo-Johnson, MS.`,

    blogTitle: "From Birth-16 Weeks",
    blogDesc: `Puppies at this age are like “babies.” They have boundless energy and curiosity. They spend most of their day playing as well as learning the foundations to being a dog: chasing, running, pawing, biting and fighting. Their enthusiasm for life and its surroundings can be exhausting, but this is also the perfect time to start thinking about a puppy care and training plan. Puppies at this age may still have a lot of playful energy. But they are also starting to test their boundaries. Like teenagers, they may seem to “forget” the rules or commands that they once followed. This is normal developmental behavior for puppies in this juvenile phase. Some of this behavior
                may be due to teething as puppies begin to lose their first set of teeth around 3-4 months of age.`,

    desc: `Like most adolescents, puppies are very rambunctious, so continue the process of training and socializing your dog during this phase. Socialization and training are necessary if you want.. your puppy to be comfortable and act acceptably in public places such as dog parks and beaches, or anywhere that she will meet new dogs and new people. You may notice that your puppy likes to play-fight with other dogs around this age. This is how puppies start to identify where they fit in with a group. This is normal behavior. It’s also around this age when some puppies show fear. If your puppy does show fear, it’s best to ignore the behavior and build his confidence through training. 
             While your puppy may now look like a full-grown adult dog, he’s still a puppy. At this age you might see a burst of puppy energy and continued boundary testing. That’s why it’s important to make sure your puppy still gets plenty of structured play and exercise. Continuing with training and socialization with other dogs is also essential at this age. Congratulations! You’ve survived puppyhood! As your puppy nears age one (up to two years for a large breed), he’s beginning to look and act more mature. He will probably still be very playful, but by now he’s learned the ropes and is much better at following the rules. By this age, your dog has reached adulthood, but changes
             in social preferences and habits can occur up to two years of age. Ongoing training will ensure a respectful and fun relationship between your dog and all human family members, which makes having an animal in the family a daily pleasure.`,

    blogDesc: `Our canine friends are very sociable creatures; as such, they don’t like to be left alone for long periods of time. Whether you’re going to work or running errands, leave your dog with something to keep them occupied. You could leave out a mentally stimulating toy for your pup while you are out. Maybe there’s a special stuffed toy or soft ball that would keep your pet entertained when they are alone. Are you worried about your dog feeling lonely? Please read our blog on how to help your pet’s separation anxiety. 
                Pretending to throw the ball can leave dogs feeling confused, annoyed and anxious. It can also take the fun out of playtime, so it’s always better to just throw the ball and enjoy your time together.`,

    desc: `Dogs find it frustrating when their owners stop them from smelling things on a walk. After all, they are inquisitive creatures who love to explore their neighborhood smell unfamiliar territory. While it can be frustrating if your dog stops every five minutes on a walk, they rely on their noses far more than we do.
           Your pup interprets yelling as angry barking, which to them means trouble. It isn’t effective for changing bad behaviors and only scares, confuses or makes them angry. Instead of yelling, stay calm and think more about the tone of your voice. A deep tone to your voice means, “Please give me your attention,” while
           a lighthearted tone means “Good job!” or “Let’s play.” By adjusting tone instead of volume, you’ll get your dog’s attention without annoying or scaring them. Much like humans, dogs also like to have their own space at times. This one can come as a surprise for some owners, but your pup might not enjoy all those
           cuddles. Dogs can interpret cuddles as a sign of dominance. So keep an eye out for distress signals. If they yawn, grunt, or fold their ears flat, stop the hugging. Every dog is different so learn to read the signs.`,
